            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>My business partner(s) and I took a 3 pronged approach to internet marketing using a variety of white-hat techniques to legitimately get our CPC, Affliate or Private Real Estate Practice website(s) to the first page of Google and often position #1 for localized keywords.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amazon Affiliate Product Marketing</li>
                <li>Google Ads CPC Product Marketing</li>
                <li>Keller Williams Real Estate Agent</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sarah has requested that I expand my examples and actual resources to a few more industries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plumbing</li>
                <li>Family Therapy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have created this guide with my lessons learned from my own personal business for friends and family who are looking to improve their own businesses. I can help you all as friends or family not get ripped off by website creation firms or internet marketings teams that would be a great start. Add some free backlinking strategies and free marketing resources at the bottom is the most I can offer. I am not currently available for consulting due to a lack of time. In addition, my expertise is a bit dated. Use at your own risk. No warranty expressed or implied.</p>

            <p>With great power comes great responsibility. Most internet marketers are shady characters that we must always avoid and never become. Avoid unethical marketing and business strategies such as</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Review bombing</li>
                <li>Manipulating google algorithms for short term gain</li>
                <li>Dumping negative backlinks on competitors</li>

                <li>Burying criminal records</li>
                <li>Posting false information (libel, defamation of character, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This could happen to you. Be warned.</p>
            <p>I have a sketchy story</p>
            <p>Lots of people pay for trash like this: Reputation Defemders is the ondustry price per month current low tier $500 to $2000 per month high tier</p>

            <h1>Lesson Learned</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>We should have taken a consistent montly paycheck before net income payouts</li>
                <li>We should have hired an accountant and/or tax lawyer</li>
                <li>We should have taken small business insurance</li>
                <li>We should have used friends and family in high school and college as content creators instead of international outsourcing.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <h1>Techniques</h1>

            <h1>Targeting Keywords</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>We exclusively used Google Adwords Keyword Planner</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/">https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li>We started broad and drilled down into multiple word keywords focusing on high volume, low competition words.</li>
                <li>For our real estate small business we also put out ads (free Google Ads Promotions where possible) to calculate our lead conversion.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <h1>How to backlink</h1>
            <p>Most backlinks that we used had keywords within the a href element. However, one of our partners made the title of a blog post page the keyword with a link directly to that blog post.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Link with URL Text (Social media and directories only allows these type of back links)</li>
                <ul>

                <li>Inexpensive India Resources were not effective</li>
                <li>Master's Degree English-Native resources were acceptable, but very expensive</li>
            </ul>
            <p>MUCH BETTER: Nieces, Nephews, Cousins, Friends, Family, etc: This was especially true for those willing to work just above minimum wage remotely as an after school job for high school and college.</p>

            <h1>Hosting</h1>
            <h2>Wordpress</h2>
            <p>Highly Recommended</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">https://wordpress.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Hostgator</h2>
            <p>We wish we would have stuck with wordpress the whole time. Managing html or javascript directly was pointless when we could have had wordpress do it for us.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.hostgator.com/">https://hostgator.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>AWS</h2>
            <p>For websites with very custom requirements such as the need for direct database access, authorization, authentication, shopping cart, billing, etc., we did write our own site with AWS</p>
            <hr />
            <h1>DNS Service</h1>
            <p>For absolute lowest price we went with https://namecheap.com. Whenever using a full hosting service like AWS or Hostgator, we went with the hosting provider which was usually an extra $3 to $5 per year. Peanuts.</p>
            <hr />
            <h1>Content on Our Websites</h1>
            <h2>Images</h2>
            <p>Although our team did not have a graphic designer we created our own images, took our own pictures and licensed images from image companies. We found that purchaising images were the best for lead generation/conversion and did not notice an SEO impact. However, Google may find duplication on images purchased from a 3rd party.</p>
            <p>Purchasing images worked well for improving conversion rates</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/">https://www.shutterstock.com/</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Videos</h2>
            <p>There was a disagreement among the partners in this area. I was able to get a nice boost on my review sites whereas the other industries did not seem to make a difference. Videos posted on our website versuss the power of a YouTube backlink has yet to be tested.</p>
            <h2>Webpage Content or Blog</h2>
            <p>We used a blog on our own site for posting content related to keywords generally 100 to 1k per month with slugs always reflecting lowercase keyword with - between each word.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.dehumidifierreviews.com/dehumidifier-reviews-for-flooded-basements">Dehumidifier Reviews for Flooded Basements</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Posting content on our actual business page itself was critical. We had launched some websites with 10 pages of content, but by the time we shut down the business most sites had between 200 and 1000 pages and/or blog posts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quiz - </li>
                <li>QuiZ blog</li>
                <li>Questionaire - Does this sound like your basement?</li>
                <li>When is it ok to use PVC instead of copper?</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <h1>Backlink Strategies</h1>
            <p>ALWAYS include a backlink in your post, page or profile.  This is in order of effectiveness that we found.  RESULTS WILL VARY!  Google's algorithm changes multiple times per day and it has been a few years.</p>
            <h2>Press Releases</h2>
            <p>Our experience showed this to be the most effective. This is especially true when one of our articles got syndicated to a variety of legitimate newspapers and news websites that we were actually familiar with.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://prweb.com">https://prweb.com</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/">https://www.prnewswire.com/</a></li>
                <li>Many others we never got a chance to try...</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Minority Owned Backlinks?</h2>
            <h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
            <p>Our experience showed this to be most effective for our release estate agent:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>At time of dissolving the business, it was still making enough for one of us to have a middle income. However, the 3 of us were all investing in our future and all 3 agree we made the right move. There was so much invaluable information learned that the business as a learning experience was worth the amount of time we put into it.</li>
                <li>A full time career, graduate school, this side business, an inhospitable business environment (States Sales Tax vs. Amazon) and a daughter on the way was too much so I left the business to the originating partner.</li>
                <li>Our originating partner sold off the business in the mid-2010s to focus on his primary discipline, archeology.</li>
                <li>Keller Williams sent a bunch of unexpected percentage-based fees that made Michigan's real estate business case no longer viable so our real estate agent partner decided to move onto other small business enterprises where he has done very well.</li>
